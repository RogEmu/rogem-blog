## What is RogEm?
RogEm is a light PSX emulator written in C++ currently in active development.
The project stemmed from a will to learn computer architecture and how hardware interacts with software at a low-level.

Currently the emulator has a debugger with basic features (registers, memory viewer/editor, assembly view and more). It runs basic test roms for the moment but we are working on booting our first game!

The journey has been exciting so far, with lots of highs and lows. Developing an emulator is not as easy as it looks. As this is our first emulator development experience, we have made some mistakes but we always try to make the emulator as simple as possible while keeping the nice features.

## Inspiration
We take a lots of our inspiration from already well established emulators such as [duckstation](https://duckstation.org/) or [PCSX Redux](https://pcsx-redux.consoledev.net/) and also from the amazing [documentation](https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/) initially written by Martin "noca$h" Korth

## The Future of this Blog
From this post on, we will try to write a weekly devlog to share our experiences, struggles and achievements during our journey. Some posts will also cover some previous parts we have already implemented since the start of the project.

Don't hesitate to share your thoughts with us in the comments section.

Thank you for having read all the way, we can't we to share more with you.
