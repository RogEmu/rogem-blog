excerpt: "An update about RogEmuPSX — a PlayStation (PSX) emulator under active development. Goals, current status, and how to help."
---


RogEmuPSX is a personal PlayStation (PSX / PS1) emulator project that I'm actively developing. The goal is to build a lightweight, accurate emulator that runs a broad set of commercial and homebrew titles, provides useful debugging tools, and remains approachable for contributors.

## Current status

- Core CPU emulation (MIPS R3000) — executing most basic instructions and simple titles.
- Basic GPU pipeline implemented — software renderer and early OpenGL backend for testing.
- CD-ROM subsystem emulated enough to load many discs and ISO images.
- Early audio (SPU) implementation — work in progress to improve timing and buffering.
- Cross-platform build scaffold and initial CI tests (unit tests for core instruction set).

This is an active project: features are landing incrementally and there are known gaps (timing, some DMA paths, complex GPU effects). See the repository README for up-to-date build badges and status boards.

## Goals and roadmap

Short-term:
- Stabilize SPU audio and reduce glitches on common titles.
- Improve GPU blend and texture handling for better graphical accuracy.
- Add save state support and frame stepping for debugging.

Medium-term:
- Implement a JIT/fast path for common instruction sequences to improve performance.
- Add a user-friendly UI with per-game settings and controller mapping.
- Integrate more automated tests using a set of verification ROMs.

Long-term:
- Reach broad compatibility with the PSX compatibility database.
- Provide tools for homebrew developers (tracing, memory inspection, breakpoints).

## How you can help

- Test: try the latest builds with freely-licensed homebrew or your legally-owned backups and report issues with logs and steps to reproduce.
- File issues: include the game, platform, emulator log, and a short description of the failure.
- Contribute code: pick small issues (marked good-first-issue) and submit PRs. Work on audio timing, GPU fixes, or test harnesses are especially welcome.
- Documentation & testing: improve README, add build matrix entries, and create reproducible tests for regressions.

Note: I cannot distribute PlayStation BIOS files. To test some games you must provide your own BIOS dumped from hardware you own; see the project README for legal guidance.

## Quick build (example)

This is an example build sequence — check the project's README for exact dependencies and commands:

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/youruser/rogem-psx.git
cd rogem-psx

# typical CMake build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)

# run with an ISO (your own BIOS required for some titles)
./rogempsx --iso ../images/some-game.iso
```

## Legal & testing notes

- Distributing copyrighted BIOS or commercial game images is illegal; always use media you legally own.
- If you share test logs or game data, strip any copyrighted blobs and include only reproducible logs or small test ROMs when possible.

## Contact & contributions

If you'd like to follow or contribute, open issues or PRs on the repository. I'm happy to review small patches and guide contributors through the codebase.
